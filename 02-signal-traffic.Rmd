# Project 1: Signalized Traffic

The main objective of this project is to design *traffic light signal* controls in order to optimize particular traffic conditions. Traffic signals regularly pre-establish fixed values *red* or *green* for a particular intersection. In fact the behavior can be modeled as: 

(ref:tlight) Traffic light signal example. 

```{r tlight, fig.cap='(ref:tlight)', fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 3.5, fig.asp= 0.7, echo= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
N <- 1 # samples 
x <- c(seq(from = 1,  to = 30,  by = N),
       seq(from = 30, to =  60,  by = N),
       seq(from = 60, to =  90,  by = N),
       seq(from = 90, to =  120, by = N))
y <- c(rep(0, 30), rep(1, 31),rep(0, 31), rep(1, 31))
df <- data.frame(c(list(x),list(y)))
names(df) <- c("Time", "Light")
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=Time,y=Light))+geom_path() + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=mean(Light)), color = "Red") + 
  labs(x='Time (s)', y = 'Light (Green/Red)')
```


The relationship between the switched green/red time in a traffic light can be represented by a pulse signal (Figure \@ref(fig:tlight)). The red line in the figure represents the *duty cycle* which represents the fraction of time the light was in green ($1$) with respect to the total cycle time ($60s$). In this case, the main objective is to study traffic models that can model signalized intersections and design control laws to design.

## Objectives {-}

The main objective of this project is to: 

1. Study the fundamental aspects of traffic signal control strategies. 
2. Obtain and simulate a macroscopic traffic model for a urban network with traffic signals 
3. Create and design control strategies applied via traffic signals in urban traffic networks. 
4. Compare the behavior of fixed time traffic signal polices and dynamic time traffic signal polices. 

## Description {-}

### Task 1: Modeling {-}

Check models for macroscopic networks, determine the parameters for a network and present why these parameters. 

#### Context {-}

Before implementing a real scenario in this phase we aim to describe the context of a virtual example. Consider the following traffic urban corridor which obeys a simplified version of the real arterial scenario. 

(ref:city) Example of traffic network. 

```{r city, fig.cap='(ref:city)', fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 4, echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/p1-01-network.png")
```

The network of Figure \@ref(fig:city) represents a regular corridor in a city like. The priority for this type of corridors is to maximize the priority of green time so the traffic does not get congested along the network. It is important to highlight that for the proposed network 

#### Questions {-}

* Based on a literature review, determine current existing traffic models for signalized traffic networks. 
* For the network in Figure \@ref(fig:city), build a macroscopic traffic model in which 
* Determine the *signalized* traffic model for the case where lights are installed along each intersection of the corridor. For those roads in which direction is not explicitly defined, consider the direction of a regular intersection. 
* Determine the minimum amount of Origin Destin


#### Expected outcomes {-}

* Present a brief summary of the existing current models for signalized traffic networks. At same time highlight the key features of these models and the remaining difficulties. Consider including references for the presented models. 

* Based on [@Grandinetti2015] obtain a model for the signalized network of Figure \@ref(fig:city) and the parameters required model this corridor. 

* Define the set of parameters for the traffic network, notably those related to the fundamental diagram as well as the traffic light signal timings. Consider a fixed setup of this parameters for the moment and overall explain the reason of the choice.  

### Task 2: Simulation {-}

Dynamic simulation  of open loop traffic networks. 

#### Context {-}

Based on the model established in the **Task 1** and considering a family of especific parameters. Perform a simulation for a constant demand value of demand in $veh/hr$ as specified in the Figure\@ref(fig:flow). 

(ref:flow) Demand profiles for a specified scenario. 

```{r flow, fig.cap='(ref:flow)', fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 4, echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/p1-02-flows.png")
```

#### Questions {-}

* Simulate and obtain density plots of the dynamic the behaviour when the *duty cyle* of lights is similar for all the traffic lights. $50\%$

* Does the current values create a congestion in the proposed network?

* How can the performance of the network be improved? Create a second set of parameters for the traffic lights *duty cycle* and 

* For the existing model and according to [@Grandinetti2015] obtain the two different *density* and *flow* dynamic profiles between a *switched* signalized traffic model and an *averaged* traffic model 

#### Expected outcomes {-}

* Present th. e dynamic profiles for density on each one of the roads under different setups of traffic lights. The dynamic profiles should specify density per road in time  

* Provide comparissons between different traffic signalized models and an analysis on how this error evolves according to different values of demand. 

* Specify a second set of parameters for *duty cycle* that could improve the performance of the network with respect to the $50\%$ case. Justify the reason of your choice and verify in results the desired behavior.
