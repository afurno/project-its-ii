# Project 1: Signalized Traffic

The main objective of this project is to design *traffic light signal* controls in order to optimize particular traffic conditions. Traffic signals regularly pre-establish fixed values *red* or *green* for a particular intersection. In fact the behavior can be modeled as: 

(ref:tlight) Traffic light signal example. 

```{r tlight, fig.cap='(ref:tlight)', fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 3.5, fig.asp= 0.7, echo= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
N <- 1 # samples 
x <- c(seq(from = 1,  to = 30,  by = N),
       seq(from = 30, to =  60,  by = N),
       seq(from = 60, to =  90,  by = N),
       seq(from = 90, to =  120, by = N))
y <- c(rep(0, 30), rep(1, 31),rep(0, 31), rep(1, 31))
df <- data.frame(c(list(x),list(y)))
names(df) <- c("Time", "Light")
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=Time,y=Light))+geom_path() + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=mean(Light)), color = "Red") + 
  labs(x='Time (s)', y = 'Light (Green/Red)')
```


The relationship between the switched green/red time in a traffic light can be represented by a pulse signal (Figure \@ref(fig:tlight)). The red line in the figure represents the *duty cycle* which represents the fraction of time the light was in green ($1$) with respect to the total cycle time ($60s$). In this case, the main objective is to study traffic models that can model signalized intersections and design control laws to design.

## Objectives {-}

The main objective of this project is to: 

1. Study the fundamental aspects of traffic signal control strategies. 
2. Obtain and simulate a macroscopic traffic model for a urban network with traffic signals 
3. Create and design control strategies applied via traffic signals in urban traffic networks. 
4. Compare the behavior of fixed time traffic signal polices and dynamic time traffic signal polices. 

## Description {-}

### Task 1: Modeling {-}

Check models for macroscopic networks, determine the parameters for a network and present why these parameters. 

#### Context {-}

Before implementing a real scenario in this phase we aim to describe the context of a virtual example. Consider the following traffic urban corridor which obeys a simplified version of the real arterial scenario. 

(ref:city) Example of traffic network. 

```{r city, fig.cap='(ref:city)', fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 4, echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/p1-01-network.png")
```

The network of Figure \@ref(fig:city) represents a regular corridor in a city like. The priority for this type of corridors is to maximize the priority of green time so the traffic does not get congested along the network. It is important to highlight that for the proposed network 

#### Questions {-}

* For the network in Figure \@ref(fig:city), build a macroscopic traffic model in which 
* Determine the *signalized* traffic model for the case where lights are installed along each intersection of the corridor. For those roads in which direction is not explicitly defined, consider the direction of a regular intersection. 
* Determine the minimum amount of Origin Destin


#### Expected outcomes {-}

* Present a brief summary of the existing current models that are 

* Design and obtain a model for a traffic signalized network of the following type 

* Define the set of parameters for the proposed scenario based on a previous calibrated traffic network.
