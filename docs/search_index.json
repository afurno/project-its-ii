Context Traffic congestion on urban roads is a problem of great interest nowadays since it strongly affects security and pollution. Workfoce centralization, population and economic growth alongside with continuous urbanization are the main causes of traffic congestion. As cities strive to update/expand the current infrastructures the development of Information Technologies bring new possiblities as an alternative solution for transportation systems. The current project aims to explore some of the new technologies used in the so called Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). They objective is to study to a certain level of detail some of the new traffic management systems that will conduct new ways of transportation in the XXI century. The general idea is based on the fact that information collected by sensors within traffic networks or in-vehicles sensors can collect information regarding the traffic condition, perform estimation of unknown traffic states and decide on specific actions to modify this state. Projects Specially, in this case the project will be focused in four main activities: Trafic signal design: This projects aims to study how to optimally deal with the design of light cycles to optimize the traffic performance. Based on information collected by infrastructure based sensors the traffic state can be determined and specific decisions in terms on green/red light times can be dynamically adapted. Connected &amp; automated vehicles: New in-vechicle sensors create situations in which vehicles may exchange information to improve traffic conditions. This project aims to study control algorithms implemented in the V2V (Vehicle-vehicle) communication layer that can be used to design traffic decisions. Eco-driving: Connectivity between vehicles and infrastructures will define future directions in transportation. Shared information in the V2I (Vehicle-infrastructure) I2V (Infrastructure-vehicle) communication layers can optimize traffic conditions in apects like fuel-efficiency. Traffic variable reconstruction: Sensors installed in traffic infrastructures provide information regarding the traffic state. Nevertheless the solution is not scalable to cover large cities due to the economical leverage required to deploy this technology. Algorithms to reconstruct traffic information may provide a promising future for accurately determine the traffic state of a city. The aim of this project is to study how multiple sources of information can be integrated to reconstruct traffic variables within a city. General Objectives Identify new technologies implemented in the Intelligent Transporation Systems and investigate how these technologies are deployed in real systems. Define and determine adequate models that are suitable for deploying new ITS technologies. Develop specific solutions for ITS that can be tested under pre-defined scenarios. "],

Problem identification &amp; literature review: This phases consists in: Identify particularly the problem under study, meaning the system to be controlled and the way it is assesed. Retrieve bibliographical information about the problem under study. Summarize the already proposed alternatives in the existing literature. The main objective of this phase is to understand what are the main challenges when solving the specific project under study and to present in general ways how this problem has been solved. Setting up a suitable model: Once the problem has been identified the main objective is to precisely describe the traffic models that are suitable for the approach. For this phase the stages are divided as: Determine a specific traffic model that can be used for the corresponding situation Define the scenario in which the solution should be tested Pre establish parameters and requirements for the solution to be implemented. Experimental results: Finally, the main objective is to perform a validation and solution for the problem under study. Several tools are provided for this purpose like micro/macro Reporting In order to fullfill the requirements for each phase each group should provide a report as follows: Report 1: Summarizes the results of the 1.

["project-1-signalized-traffic.html", "Chapter 2 Project 1: Signalized Traffic Objectives Description Sources", " Chapter 2 Project 1: Signalized Traffic The main objective of this project is to design traffic light signal controls in order to optimize particular traffic conditions. Traffic signals regularly pre-establish fixed values red or green for a particular intersection. In fact the behavior can be modeled as: Figure 2.1: Traffic light signal example. The relationship between the switched green/red time in a traffic light can be represented by a pulse signal (Figure 2.1). The red line in the figure represents the duty cycle which represents the fraction of time the light was in green (\\(1\\)) with respect to the total cycle time (\\(60s\\)). In this case, the main objective is to study traffic models that can model signalized intersections and design control laws to design. Objectives The main objective of this project is to: Study the fundamental aspects of traffic signal control strategies. Obtain and simulate a macroscopic traffic model for a urban network with traffic signals Create and design control strategies applied via traffic signals in urban traffic networks. Compare the behavior of fixed time traffic signal polices and dynamic time traffic signal polices. Description Task 1: Modeling Check models for macroscopic networks, determine the parameters for a network and present why these parameters. Context Before implementing a real scenario in this phase we aim to describe the context of a virtual example. Consider the following traffic urban corridor which obeys a simplified version of the real arterial scenario. Figure 2.2: Example of traffic network. The network of Figure 2.2 represents a regular corridor in a city like. The priority for this type of corridors is to maximize the priority of green time so the traffic does not get congested along the network. It is important to highlight that for the proposed network Questions Based on a literature review, determine current existing traffic models for signalized traffic networks. For the network in Figure 2.2, build a macroscopic traffic model in which Determine the signalized traffic model for the case where lights are installed along each intersection of the corridor. For those roads in which direction is not explicitly defined, consider the direction of a regular intersection. Determine the minimum amount of Origin Destin Expected outcomes Present a brief summary of the existing current models for signalized traffic networks. At same time highlight the key features of these models and the remaining difficulties. Consider including references for the presented models. Based on (Grandinetti, Canudas-de-wit, and Garin 2015) obtain a model for the signalized network of Figure 2.2 and the parameters required model this corridor. Define the set of parameters for the traffic network, notably those related to the fundamental diagram as well as the traffic light signal timings. Consider a fixed setup of this parameters for the moment and overall explain the reason of the choice. Task 2: Simulation Dynamic simulation of open loop traffic networks. Context Based on the model established in the Task 1 and considering a family of especific parameters. Perform a simulation for a constant demand value of demand in \\(veh/hr\\) as specified in the Figure2.3. Figure 2.3: Demand profiles for a specified scenario. Questions Simulate and obtain density plots of the dynamic the behaviour when the duty cyle of lights is similar for all the traffic lights. \\(50\\%\\) Does the current values create a congestion in the proposed network? How can the performance of the network be improved? Create a second set of parameters for the traffic lights duty cycle and For the existing model and according to (Grandinetti, Canudas-de-wit, and Garin 2015) obtain the two different density and flow dynamic profiles between a switched signalized traffic model and an averaged traffic model Expected outcomes Present th. e dynamic profiles for density on each one of the roads under different setups of traffic lights. The dynamic profiles should specify density per road in time Provide comparissons between different traffic signalized models and an analysis on how this error evolves according to different values of demand. Specify a second set of parameters for duty cycle that could improve the performance of the network with respect to the \\(50\\%\\) case. Justify the reason of your choice and verify in results the desired behavior.
